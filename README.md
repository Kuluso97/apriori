# Apriori Algorithm Implementation (Python)

A simple implementation of the Apriori Algorithm for frequent pattern data mining.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python 3.6 installed on your computer

## Running the tests
To run the test or test the code on any data, please type the following command in your terminal

```
python(or python3) apriori.py (name of your test file) (minimum support) (outputfileName)
```
### Test results

For the CS378 homework, the code performance on these three cases are as follow:

```
minimum count       performance
2000				1.98s
1000				4.56s
500					8.80s
```
